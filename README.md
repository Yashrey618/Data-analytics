 In this work, I present analytical results obtained by data mining on the START (Study of Terrorism and Response to Terrorism) dataset. The main objective is to visualize terrorism data and make it available to users in an easy to understand format. A website is designed which contains a collection of various analyses and visualizations to interpret patterns and trends in it. The website also contains a visualization tool that provides the user with dataset exploration capabilities.
Lack of understanding and awareness about global terrorism leads to diverse opinions and common misconceptions among civilians. In this age of globalization, sufficient information about this topic can help strengthen our counter-terrorism strategies, improvise security concerns, regulate better economic policies and enhance the knowledge base of civilians.
The primary dataset for this project is provided by START Consortium which contains data of terrorist events since 1970. Performing various data mining and data visualization techniques to interpret the nature of terrorism to better understand its trends and patterns in over 45 years of its recorded history.
The dataset is taken from https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/access/
